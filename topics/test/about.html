            <p>The word that gets me is unstoppable, and let me shed some light on why. One thing that I tend to speak a lot about is the importance of consistency. With every positive choice or action your identity grows deeper and your resilience grows heavier. A result of consistency over time is momentum, which  is a measurement of your mass,(how difficult you are to move), and your velocity,(how fast youâ€™re going). The more momentum something has, the more unstoppable it is!</p>
